Implementation of machine learning algorithms to classify the testing images into object categories, using CIFAR-100 dataset. Implemented code to visualise the images and compute features to use in the proposed machine 
learning algorithms. Used the model to perform classification and reported quantitative results. Presented a scientific approach, where made suitable comparison between three methods.
